## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy and execution plan for the **Howmuch POS** system — a cross-platform point-of-sale and inventory management solution designed for retail businesses. The test plan ensures structured, consistent, and high-quality testing of its Admin Panel (web-based) and desktop application (Electron-based), helping to maintain product stability, usability, and performance across all environments.

## 2. Objectives

- Validate core features and business logic of each module.
- Identify and report defects across staging and production environments.
- Ensure feature stability across Electron (macOS/Windows) and Admin Panel platforms.
- Maintain a reliable feedback loop between testing and development through continuous build validation.

---

## 3. Scope

### In-Scope
- Functional, UI, regression, and exploratory testing for:
  - Admin Panel (web, staging and production)
  - Electron Desktop App (Windows/macOS)
- Arabic language support validation (where applicable)
- Module-level validation (test cases maintained per feature)
- Hardware-specific integration testing (e.g., POS printers, barcode scanners)
  

### Out of Scope
- Native mobile applications (Android/iOS) — to be covered in future phases


---

## 4. Testing Approach

### Test Types
- Manual Testing (primary approach)
- Functional & Regression Testing
- API testing
- Cross-platform Testing
- UI/UX Consistency Testing
- Build Issue Validation and Fix Verification

### Testing Levels
- Module-Level Testing (based on defined test cases)
- End-to-End Workflow Verification
- Smoke Testing for builds (pre/post-deployment)

### Bug Lifecycle
- Continuous issue discovery, documentation, and verification
- Close coordination with the dev team for fix validation across builds

## 11. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk                                     | Mitigation Strategy                                         |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Limited QA bandwidth (single tester)     | Focus on core flows and high-priority issues first          |
| No automation in place                   | Strong manual regression coverage and planning for future CI |
| Frequent build changes/fixes             | Tight feedback loop with development, quick smoke testing   |

---

## 12. Schedule

Testing is ongoing and aligned with development pace. No strict sprints or release cycles currently in place.
